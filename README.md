Twitter Bot Experiment:

I love pizza but always end up ordering the same kind every time. So I coded a Pizza Party Bot, which picks 3 toppings from a list of 31 and tweets new ideas in 15 minute intervals. Who's hungry?

The inspiration for this experiment came after watching a video on Twitter Bots, published on YouTube by Daniel Shiffman. The bot was deployed to Heroku and ran for almost 2 months. On 5/14/17, after 6,006 tweets, I decided to retire the Pizza Party Bot experiment to focus on other projects.
