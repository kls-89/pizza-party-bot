Twitter Bot Experiment:

I love pizza but always end up ordering the same kind every time. So I coded a Pizza Party Bot, which picks 3 toppings from a list of 31 and tweets new ideas in 15 minute intervals.

5/14/17 After 6,006 tweets, I've decided to retire the Pizza Party Bot experiment. I'll work on a new idea soon! Thanks for following along!
